Hi everyone, thanks for joining this meeting today. I'm excited to discuss our new AI project. Hi Sarah, what's the project about? We are thinking about developing a new AI-based virtual assistant for personal use. That sounds interesting. What kind of features are we thinking about adding? We want to make the virtual assistant more personalized, improve its natural language processing, and add support for smart home devices. That sounds like a cool project. How long do we think it will take to develop this virtual assistant? We're looking at around 9 to 12 months. We'll need a team of developers, data scientists, and UX designers to work on it. John: Do we have enough resources to pull this off? I've spoken to our CEO, and they are willing to invest in this project. We just need to make sure we have the right team in place.What kind of challenges do we anticipate? Well, we'll need to collect a lot of data to train the virtual assistant. And we'll need to ensure its user interface is easy to use and intuitive. And what about security? That's a great point, David. We'll need to ensure the virtual assistant is secure and user data is protected. John: It sounds like we have a lot of work ahead of us. But it's an exciting project, and we have a great team in place. I'm looking forward to getting started. Same here. Let's do this.
